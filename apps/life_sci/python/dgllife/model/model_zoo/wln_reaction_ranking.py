    The model is introduced in `Predicting Organic Reaction Outcomes with
    Weisfeiler-Lehman Network <https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04555>`__ and then
    further improved in `A graph-convolutional neural network model for the
    prediction of chemical reactivity
    <https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/sc/c8sc04228d#!divAbstract>`__

    The model updates representations of nodes in candidate products with WLN and predicts
    the score for candidate products to be the real product.
