### Hierarchical Graph VAE

This is an implementation of the hierarchical graph variational autoencoder described in ["Hierarchical Generation of Molecular Graphs using Structural Motifs"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.03230.pdf).

A demonstration of dataset loading, preprocessing, model instantiation, training, teaching-forcing, and evaluation is in notebook.ipynb.
