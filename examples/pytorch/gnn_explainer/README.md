# GNN Explainer

In the context of DGL, implement the paper [GNNExplainer: Generating Explanations for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03894).

Author's [codes](https://github.com/RexYing/gnn-model-explainer).

The author's implementation is kind of experimental with unclean codes. So this implementation focuses on a subset of
GNN Explainer's functions, node classification, and later on extend to edge classification.
