class EdgeConv(nn.Module):
    r"""EdgeConv layer.

    Introduced in "`Dynamic Graph CNN for Learning on Point Clouds
    <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07829>`__".  Can be described as follows:

    .. math::
       x_i^{(l+1)} = \max_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \mathrm{ReLU}(
       \Theta \cdot (x_j^{(l)} - x_i^{(l)}) + \Phi \cdot x_i^{(l)})

    where :math:`\mathcal{N}(i)` is the neighbor of :math:`i`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    in_feat : int
        Input feature size.
    out_feat : int
        Output feature size.
    batch_norm : bool
        Whether to include batch normalization on messages.

                # (2) Even if the point clouds always have the same number of
                #     points, the points may as well be shuffled even with the
                #     same (type of) object (and the official implementation
