    """Perform Matrix multiplication C = A * B but A could be an integer id vector.

    If A is an integer vector, we treat it as multiplying a one-hot encoded tensor.
    In this case, the expensive dense matrix multiply can be replaced by a much
    cheaper index lookup.

    For example,
    ::

        A = [2, 0, 1],
        B = [[0.1, 0.2],
             [0.3, 0.4],

    then matmul_maybe_select(A, B) is equivalent to
